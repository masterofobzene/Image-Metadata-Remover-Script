# Image-Metadata-Remover-Script
Removes metadata AKA (EXIF) information on all images detected (except .gif files)

This script will remove metadata from the images found on the passed path including its subfolders.

* Since the script corrupts animated .gif files, those files are ignored by the script.
* __WARNING:__ Source files are replaced with the metadata-removed version.
